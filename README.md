## :fountain: LINK Faucet

Get 20 Chainlink (LINK) tokens every 12 hours.

Chainlink tokens allow you to pay Chainlink oracles for services, like offchain data requests to be stored on chain.

:warning: We have a UP relay option for the faucet, but we don't have this shown in the frontend. See the scripts in the contracts repo for more info. :warning:

## :bird: Twitter Name Space

Prove your Twitter and wallet connection using a Chainlink oracle request.

Proof contract works when Chainlink node runs with verified Twitter IDs:
